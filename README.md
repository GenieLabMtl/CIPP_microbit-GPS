# CIPP_microbit-GPS


## Preparation steps
You will need the following to do the activity:

- Mu Editor: to edit and upload the code to the device. [Download here](https://codewith.mu/en/download)
- micro-bit
- gps module
- wire stripper
- soldering iron
- heatshrink tube
- hot air gun


*Start Mu Editor and get code on the micro:bit*

this code will be in python as we need to use advanced features not found in the editor we usually use, which is [makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/).  This is a great ressource to learn the basics of programming as you start with a simplified visual coding language, and you can switch to JavaScript or Python at anytime to see how the code looks in these popular languages.

Python is a very common programming language that is pretty easy to learn.  However, the goal of this activity is to get the GPS going, so we will use a "copy-paste" approach to code the micro:bit.  You could simply load the files on the device without looking at any of it, but by copy-pasting you can at least get a sense of if this might interest you for other projects.  
To learn more about the python programming language, [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) is a great place to start.
