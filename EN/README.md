<br>
This website, as well as other similar ones like gitlab and bitbucket, are used by pretty much all programmers to store their projects, collaborate, and keep an history of all changes made to project files, which is called "version control".  The readme files – like the one you are reading now – of this project will guide you along the activity.

## Summary

- [Preparation steps](#preparation-steps)
- [Start Mu Editor and get code on the micro:bit](#start-mu-editor-and-get-code-on-the-micro:bit)
- [Get GPS to store location on device](https://github.com/GenieLabMtl/CIPP_microbit-GPS/tree/main/EN/1)
- [Find your way to a GPS location](https://github.com/GenieLabMtl/CIPP_microbit-GPS/tree/main/EN/2)

## Preparation steps
You will need the following items to do the activity.  Ask someone working at the lab if something is missing or does not seem to work as it should.

1. <ins>Mu Editor</ins>: to edit and upload the code to the device. [Download it here](https://codewith.mu/en/download) if it's not already installed on the computer.
2. <ins>Micro:bit v2</ins>: Don't let it's simplicity fool you, it is an extremely capable device. You can find more info on that most excellent tool [here](https://microbit.org/).
3. <ins>Gps module</ins>: We are using a VK282U7G5LF. If you are currious about it, you can find out more about it by consulting its [datasheet](https://github.com/CainZ/V.KEL-GPS/blob/master/VK2828U7G5LF%20Data%20Sheet%2020150902.pdf).
4. Battery holder with batteries.
5. USB cable
6. The canoe made during the previous activities.

## Start Mu Editor and get code on the micro:bit

This code is written in the python programming language as we need to use advanced features not found in the editor we usually use, which is [makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/).  You should still check it out as it is a great ressource to learn the basics of programming as you start with a simplified visual coding language, and you can switch to JavaScript or Python at anytime to see how the code looks in these popular languages.

Python is a very common programming language that is pretty easy to learn.  However, the goal of this activity is to get the GPS going, so we will use a "copy-paste" approach to code the micro:bit. 
To learn more about the python programming language, [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) is a great place to start.
