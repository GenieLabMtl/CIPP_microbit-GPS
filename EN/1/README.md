<h1 align="center"> Part 1 : Get GPS to store location on device </h1>

We want to store a GPS location that we like. Perfect! Turns out we can do that with the components we have to our disposal!

The code we will use today works pretty easily:

> - Press A to start capturing your current location. 
> - Wait a few seconds to make sure we have a few valid readings.
> - Press A again to stop capturing.

That's all we need to do! GPS locations will be saved to the micro:bit in files called gps01.csv, gps02.csv, etc. and which look like this:

Coordinates are stored in Degrees Decimal format. These values are obtained from the information transmitted by the GPS module and which look like this:
