<h1 align="center"> Part 1 : Get GPS to store location on device </h1>

We want to store a GPS location that we like. Perfect! Turns out we can do that with the components we have to our disposal!

The code we will use today works pretty easily:

> - Press A to start capturing your current location. 
> - Wait a few seconds to make sure we have a few valid readings.
> - Press A again to stop capturing.

That's all we need! The GPS locations will be stored on the micro:bit on files called gps01.csv, gps02.csv, etc. and will look something like this:

The coordinates are stored in the Degrees Minutes format. To use them in the next step or in Google Earth, for example, we will need to convert them to Decimal degree, which can be done conveniently on [this website](https://coordinates-converter.com/en/).
