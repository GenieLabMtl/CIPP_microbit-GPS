<h1 align="center"> Part 1.1 : The code </h1>

1. As the code is quite complexe, it is provided in it's entirety. Download it to your computer by right-clicking anywhere on the page and Save as...

    ### [Download the code here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenieLabMtl/CIPP_microbit-GPS/7761d36211a08e31bb17217241e255173bdf71ff/code/GPStoCSV.py).

2. Open Mu Editor. Make sure you are in the "BBC micro:bit" mode.

3. Load the GPStoCSV.py file you just downloaded is step 1.

4. This code is pretty straight forward.  First, it establishes a connection with the GPS module.  Then, you use the A button to switch between "standby mode", where nothing is really happening, and "record mode", where your current location is being written every few seconds to a file on the micro:bit.  By pressing the B button, you can have a reminder of which mode you are in: a target in capture mode, and a smile in standby mode.  That's all you need to store GPS locations!

5. To upload the code to the micro:bit, you need to connect the device to your computer with the USB cable. The MU Editor should detect it quickly. Then, click on the "Flash" button to install the program. When the orange light at the back of the micro:bit stops flashing, it's done.
